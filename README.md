# CL (Claudia Lopez)

##Â ToDo
* Use a lemmatizer instead of a stemmer
* Perhaps using the tokenizer from ntlk could help a little
* Count the number of times the feature appears
* Change the SVM to a linear kernel
* Change to the feature extraction from module 3 (last video)
* Run with all features
