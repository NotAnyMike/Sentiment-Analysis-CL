# CL (Claudia Lopez)

## ToDo
* Use a lemmatizer instead of a stemmer
* Perhaps using the tokenizer from ntlk could help a little
* Count the number of times the feature appears
* Change the SVM to a linear kernel
* Change to the feature extraction from module 3 (last video)
* Run with all features

## General information

### Parts of the project
The project is organized as follows:
1.
2.

## Tunning
The idea is to write all the results of different settigns of the models in a table to make it easy to check

### Random Forest settings

modelo		| cpd		| cpd 	| tf-idf
 ---	 		| ---		| ---		| ---
**min_df** 		| .001	| .01		| .001
scr train | 97% 	| .92		| 0.9735
scr test 	| 0.74 	| .70		| 0.7229

### SVM Settings

## Useful commands
* `workon CL` to start the virtualenv
* `jupyter notebook`: to run the jupyter notebook
* `mkvirtualenv -p python3 <name>` to create an enviroment using python3

## Useful jupyter commands
* `z`: undo
* `Esc`: Leave command mode
